Main formulas required to understand SVM.py file:

regularizer term is min(||w||^2 /2)
- utilized the maximize the margin and minimize loss

gradient descent needs the regularizer and the error term to define an optimization term:
optimization term looks like the following 
<p>
    <span>&Sigma;</span>
    k ( N - k + 1 )
</p>
